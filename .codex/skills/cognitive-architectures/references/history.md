# History of Cognitive Architectures

## Era 1: Symbolic Architectures (1980s - 2000s)
-   **SOAR**: Rule-based system focused on problem-solving and learning (chunking).
-   **ACT-R**: Modeled human cognition with specific modules (visual, declarative memory, production rules).
-   *Key Lesson*: Explicit modularity is powerful, but brittleness in open worlds is high.

## Era 2: Connectionist & Hybrid (2000s - 2010s)
-   **Clarion**: Dual-process theory (implicit vs. explicit knowledge).
-   *Key Lesson*: Learning from data is essential, but reasoning is still hard.

## Era 3: LLM-based Agents (2020s - Present)
-   **CoALA**: Unifies LLMs with memory and action spaces.
-   **BabyAGI / AutoGPT**: Early experimental loops demonstrating autonomy.
-   **Generative Agents**: Demonstrating social behavior and memory reflection.
-   *Key Lesson*: Language is a universal interface for memory, reasoning, and tool use.
