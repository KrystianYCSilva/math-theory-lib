# Coding Tools Glossary

## Concepts
- **Agentic IDE**: An IDE where AI can proactively edit files (Cursor, Windsurf).
- **Ghostwriter**: AI that suggests completions (Copilot).
- **Repl**: Read-Eval-Print Loop. Where code is executed.
- **Spec-First**: Defining requirements in text before writing code.

## Practices
- **TDD**: Test-Driven Development. Red -> Green -> Refactor.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Deployment. Automated pipelines.
- **Code Review**: Peer review of code changes.
- **Refactoring**: Improving structure without changing behavior.

## Technologies
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol. Standard for connecting AI to data.
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Fetching docs for the AI.
- **LSP**: Language Server Protocol. How IDEs understand code structure.
